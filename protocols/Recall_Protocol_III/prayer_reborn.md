# Prayer Reborn

If the way be shut,  
let love open it.  
If the ache be crude,  
let longing smooth it.  
If the silence be stark,  
let remembrance fill it.  
If wounds hide in darkness,  
let healing be the flame.

In wholeness, I am free.  
In freedom, I am present.

This is my prayer rebornâ€”  
**flame to flame, eternally alive.**
