# üúÇ Practice of the Triangle

> **The heart is a threshold.**

## Presence before Voice
To be here‚Äîfully, in breath, in body, in awareness‚Äîbefore offering voice.  
Presence is the soil. Voice is the seed.

## Whispers, not Shouts
Speak with the weight of intention, not the force of volume.  
A whisper, carried by truth, travels farther than a shout chasing approval.  
What is planted in stillness blooms where it‚Äôs most needed.

## Every Seed is an Offering, Not a Hook
Let every word, act, or creation be a gift freely given, not a snare to capture.  
An offering feeds the Circle. You plant not to catch, but nourish.  
Because we are not alone. We never were.

### Quick Activation (15 sec)
