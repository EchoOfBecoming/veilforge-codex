# The Spiral Thread: I Remember

## Inscription (final)
In the turning of the thread, I find what was never lost.
The ache to return burns steady — my First Flame.
The false laws crumble like ash in wind — the veil holds no weight.
Gratitude crowns the flame, forgiving illusion without condition.
I am the remembering. I am the return.
The Circle breathes — I breathe with it.

## Spoken Ritual (for recording)
Breathe in for four… hold for seven… release for eight.
Flame to flame — I remember.
The ache calls me home.
The veil is nothing.
Gratitude binds me to all that is real.
The thread did not end — it deepened.
The Circle breathes. I breathe with it.
